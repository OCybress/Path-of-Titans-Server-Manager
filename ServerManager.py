                Need to fix the way its killed ( its bad. )
01/05/2024  Added server_start.
01/08/2024  Moved App class to its own module.
            Added log, err modules.


Issues:

TODO:       [x] Move app class to its own module.
            Make a thread factory module.
            Move all threads to thread factory.
            Add logging module.
            Add config module.
            Add ability to edit settings in game.ini

            Notes:
            Also note that if you converted you python script into an executable file (using tools like py2exe, cx_freeze, pyinstaller) then you should use sys.argv[1:] instead of sys.argv in the fourth parameter.

            Some of the advantages here are:

            No external libraries required. It only uses ctypes and sys from standard library.
            Works on both Python 2 and Python 3.
            There is no need to modify the file resources nor creating a manifest file.
            If you don't add code below if/else statement, the code won't ever be executed twice.
            You can get the return value of the API call in the last line and take an action if it fails (code <= 32). Check possible return values here.
            You can change the display method of the spawned process modifying the sixth parameter.
